            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have seen none from you, however I will not omit to give you an account of passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges here: the inclosed will shew you the undaunted resolution of the Ministry; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go on to raise their Force, and those that are now ready are about Dumfreese, they are some 2000. Horse, and 4000. Foot at the most; but I believe by the 10. of July they will be 12000. Foot, and 4500. Horse, with those now coming over out of Ireland, &amp; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before that time, it is confidently reported they will be in England, and the Garrisons of Barwick, and Carlile, Garrisoned by the Scots: believe it sir, there was never such oppression of the godly in Scotland, and no hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse: there lyeth such an overawing Force upon them, or else most part are very willing; their Army rises heavily, and most of their old Souldiers desert them: and indeed thus
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:161946:3"/>much take from me, that 2000. of these men are not able to fight with 800. of our men that resolve to fight: and then for their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Montrosses men were not neer so bad: what the Lord will do, to himself is only known; his people desire to live by Faith, for indeed there is nothing else to lay hold upon: The Prince is expected shortly hither to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick. I suppose I shall see you before it be long, for the Commissioners get no satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry answers to any thing, but the more is offerd, the more haste is made to get up a Force: but if yet we could send any considerable Body to the borders, things would quickly change. I believe the Post came in at his time, but we had no Letters nor news, but what is blown about by the contrary Party, viz. That there is rising in all parts of England, and except they get in quickly, all will be done before they come. Sir, I shall not enlarge, only desire the assistance of your prayers for</p>

            </head>
            <p n="1">1. WE are to mourn for all the sins and provocation mentioned in the causes of our former humiliation, which did continue and abound notwithstanding all our Obligations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our wayes, and many former solemn Professions of Repentance, and withall the sharp Rods, wherewith God hath corrected; and heavy Judgments, wherewith he now threatens us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are in a special way to be humbled for the countenance that hath been given, and compliance that hath been made by too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, with Malignants, &amp; persons disaffected to the work of Reformation, which in the just
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161946:4"/>Judgment of God, hath at last put such power and strength in their hands, as is terrible to the People of God, and threatens his work with ruin.</p>
            <p n="3">We are to bewail the small proficiency un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the preaching of the Gospel of many, the great contempt thereof in others, and the great obstinacy and hardness of heart in some, not only unto the despising and reproaching of their Ministry, but unto the rejecting the most powerful word of exhortation in the mouth of his servants.</p>
            <p n="4">We are to be humbled for the grievous backsliding that is amongst us, which hath prevailed unto the undertaking of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Engagement of War, notwithstanding the many Petitions from Burroughs and Shires, Presbyters Synods to the contrary; which undertakings, besides many sad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects amongst our selves is like to rent in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, and not only obstruct the work of Uniformity, but overturn the Foundation already laid.</p>
            <p n="5">We are to lament before the Lord the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of his people in many places of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:161946:4"/>Kingdom unto the spoiling of their goods, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering violence unto their persons, and forcing of their consciences, and by causing them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to endure great affliction, or to sin against God by being accessary to a sinful course.</p>
            <p n="6">We are deeply to be humbled, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being now risen, they have been so far from satisfying any of the just and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry desires of the Kirk, or harkening to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions presented unto them, that they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned obedience to all their Orders upon the grounds of their Declaration published in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril.</p>
            <p n="7">We are to intreat the Lord in the behalf of our King, that he may be convinced, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the evil of his former ways, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined unto the love and approbation of the work of God, and in the behalf of those that have the power of the Kingdom in their hands, that they may desist from every sinful course, and satisfie the just and necessary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of the Kirk, and the consciences of the well-affected in the Land by securing Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and preserving Union betwixt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Monarchical Government, in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:161946:5"/>Person of the King and his Posterity.</p>
            <p n="8">We are to beg of God, that all the purposes both of Sectaries, and of the Popish, Prelatical and Malignant party in all the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, against the Truth and Work of God, may be disappointed &amp; their power crushed: So also that the Lord would strengthen his people in all these dominions, to adhere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shrinking or fainting to the Cause of God and to bear a faithful testimony thereof in the day of trouble.</p>
            <p n="9">Lastly, We are to pray for a blessing upon the ensuing general Assembly, that they may meet in peace and love; and being furnished with the spirit of Unity, Faithfulness, Wisdom and Zeal, they may so carry themselves in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, as that the hopes and designs of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected men may be disappointed; Truth maybe preserved, Holiness promoted amongst our selves, and the works of Uniformity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced amongst our Neighbours.</p>
